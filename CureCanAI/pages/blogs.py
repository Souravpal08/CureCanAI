        "content": """
        Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. 
        Not all tumors are cancerous; benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body.
        There are over 100 types of cancer, including breast cancer, skin cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer.
        Early detection and treatment can significantly improve the prognosis for many types of cancer.

        "content": """
        Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we approach cancer detection. With advanced algorithms, 
        AI can analyze medical images, identify patterns, and even predict cancer with higher accuracy than traditional methods.
        AI tools are being developed to assist radiologists and pathologists, helping to reduce the burden of manual analysis.
        However, AI is a complement, not a replacement, for expert medical judgment.

        "content": """
        Regular screenings are a key factor in cancer prevention and early detection. 
        Common screening tests include mammograms for breast cancer, colonoscopies for colon cancer, and Pap tests for cervical cancer.
        Early detection through screening increases the chances of successful treatment and survival.
        Always consult with your healthcare provider to understand which screenings are appropriate for you based on your age and risk factors.

        "content": """
        Oncology has seen a rapid development in treatments over the last decade. 
        Immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and personalized medicine are at the forefront of cancer treatment. 
        These therapies target cancer cells specifically, reducing the damage to healthy cells and improving patient outcomes.
        Ongoing research continues to improve the efficacy of these treatments, bringing hope to patients worldwide.

        Proper nutrition plays a crucial role in cancer recovery and overall well-being. 
        Certain foods may help strengthen the immune system, reduce inflammation, and support the body during and after treatment.
        A balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins, is recommended for cancer patients. 
        Consult with a dietitian to create a personalized plan tailored to your needs during recovery.
